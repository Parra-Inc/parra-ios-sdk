// Needs
// 1. Logging events without waiting.
// 2. Thread safe state to know if there is pending sync data
// 3. Ability to wait on writes to finish when logging if desired
// 4. Open file handle when session starts
// 5. Log events to memory as soon as their written
// 6. Events are written to disk in batches
// 7. Certain high priority events trigger a write immediately

/// Handles receiving logs, session properties and events and coordinates passing these
/// to other services responsible for underlying storage.
///
/// Some important notes working with this class:
/// 1. For any method with the `Sync` suffix, you should always assume that it is a hard
///    requirement for it to be called on a specific queue. Usually ``eventQueue``.
